                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my webpage! In this section, I will introduce myself and share some of my interests and
                    achievements. My name is Maxwell Metzner and I am a computer science student at Stevens Institute of
                    Technology. I will be graduating in May 2023 with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>I am very interested in AI, algorithmic trading, and software development. I have always been
                    fascinated by how computers can solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. I enjoy
                    learning new skills and technologies and applying them to real-world scenarios.</p>
                <p>Some of my main accomplishments are my work experience as an IT security and compliance intern at the
                    pharmaceutical company Eisai and my senior design project which used deep learning and algorithmic
                    trading to trade currency pairs for the company TLCengine. At Eisai, I helped to monitor and audit
                    the IT systems and processes to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and best practices. I
                    also assisted in developing and testing security policies and procedures. At TLCengine, I worked
                    with a team of four students to design and implement a system that used historical and live data to
                    predict the movements of currency pairs and execute trades accordingly. We used Python, TensorFlow,
                    Keras, and MetaTrader 4 to build our system.</p>
                <p>If you want to know more about me or my projects, you can reach me through LinkedIn or email through
                    the hyperlinks below. I am always open to new opportunities and challenges.</p>
                <p>As for extracurricular activities, I like to play volleyball and I have competed on my high school
                    club team, college club team and have played at nationals for both. I also like playing beach
                    volleyball when the weather permits. Volleyball is a great way to stay fit, have fun, and meet new
                    people. I also enjoy watching professional volleyball matches and learning from the best players in
                    the world.</p>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my webpage and I hope you enjoyed reading about me. Feel free to browse the
                    other sections of my webpage to see some of my work samples.</p>

                            <p>This course taught me how to use data structures, algorithms, and
                                object-oriented programming to solve various problems. We worked on projects such as
                                finding duplicates in strings, implementing Djikstra’s algorithm for shortest paths,
                                calculating square roots using Newton’s method, and more.</p>
