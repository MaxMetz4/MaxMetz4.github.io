            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my webpage! In this section, I will introduce myself and share some of my interests and achievements. My name is Maxwell Metzner and I am a computer science student at Stevens Institute of Technology. I will be graduating in May 2023 with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science.</p>
            <p>I am very interested in AI, algorithmic trading, and software development. I have always been fascinated by how computers can solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. I enjoy learning new skills and technologies and applying them to real-world scenarios.</p>
            <p>Some of my main accomplishments are my work experience as an IT security and compliance intern at the pharmaceutical company Eisai and my senior design project which used deep learning and algorithmic trading to trade currency pairs for the company TLCengine. At Eisai, I helped to monitor and audit the IT systems and processes to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and best practices. I also assisted in developing and testing security policies and procedures. At TLCengine, I worked with a team of four students to design and implement a system that used historical and live data to predict the movements of currency pairs and execute trades accordingly. We used Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and MetaTrader 4 to build our system. We achieved an average return of 15% over six months of testing.</p>
            <p>If you want to know more about me or my projects, you can reach me through LinkedIn or email through the hyperlinks below. I am always open to new opportunities and challenges.</p>
            <p>As for extracurricular activities, I like to play volleyball and I have competed on my high school club team, college club team and have played at nationals for both. I also like playing beach volleyball when the weather permits. Volleyball is a great way to stay fit, have fun, and meet new people. I also enjoy watching professional volleyball matches and learning from the best players in the world.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my webpage and I hope you enjoyed reading about me. Feel free to browse the other sections of my webpage to see some of my work samples and testimonials.</p>
